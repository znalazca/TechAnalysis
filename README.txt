This project is a technical analysis suite capable of running on
Windows CE devices (libraries and plugins). Host application is targeted for 
Windows Desktop.

It is better to open solution using SharpDevelop 3.2 with .NET Framework 3.5
installed.

Distributed under MIT licence (except icons - their source is unknown).

It does not have any 3-rd party components.

This project is considered as alpha. Also I gave it up long time
ago when Windows CE died completely. Currently it just is a demonstration of 
plugin-based application design.

Yahoo Finance API is not supported for a long time but project includes 
some source files with quotes data so charts may be build.

If you want to build an expression tree use ParseProject parser.
